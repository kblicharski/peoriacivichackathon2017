=============


There are 3 basic types of pavement preservation treatments that are used within the City of Peoria:

**Seal Coating** – also known as chip sealing, involves spraying the road with oil and then applying rock chips that are rolled with equipment to embed the chips into the oil.  The excess rock chips are swept up after 2 weeks of being open to traffic.

**Microsurfacing** – also known as slurry seal, is a mix of asphalt emulsion and aggregates that are placed on the existing roadway.  Microsurfacing cures as the water evaporates leaving only the asphalt coated aggregates.  

**CRF** – is a restorative treatment that uses an oil emulsion that is sprayed on the roadway, and then lime screenings are applied to the roadway.  Several days later the excess screenings are swept up and removed.
