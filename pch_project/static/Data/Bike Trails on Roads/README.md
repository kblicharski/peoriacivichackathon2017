Bike Trails on Roads
=============
 
Road segments that contain bike paths.

The City has a Bicycle Master Plan that is used to promote bicycling as a viable transportation option.  The goal of the plan is to improve safety and comfort for bicyclists, and create connectivity throughout the City in an effort to transform Peoria into a bicycle friendly community.  Bicycle lanes and multi-use paths are being constructed in conjunction with our road projects that are being built.  Occassionally, the roadway has to share space with bicyclists.  Shared lane markings or “sharrows” are street markings that helps guide bicyclist when they are sharing the roadway with vehicles.
