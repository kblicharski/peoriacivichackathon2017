Ramp Construction
=================

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) sets certain guidelines for sidewalk construction to make it easier for people with disabilities to use City sidewalks.  These guidelines include things like the minimum width of a sidewalk, maximum cross slopes, and the locations of pedestrian push buttons to name a few.
